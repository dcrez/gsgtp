<li>Maximum engine displacement: 1500 cc (91.5 cu.in.).</li>
<li>Must be naturally aspirated, unless diesel. Diesel limited to 2 turbos.</li>
<li>Maximum tire size: 12" wide rim with a max of 84" circumference. This is for Asphalt tires only. Dirt tires the max size is 26x12x12</li>
<li>Gasoline, diesel, or alcohol fuels.</li>
<li>Maximum weight of vehicle and driver: 1150, 1250 lbs.</li>
<li>Turbine Engines: All Super Modified rules apply for chassis, tire size, and maximum combined weight limit with the following turbine engine limits.
<ul>
<li>Gas turbine engine with a factory horsepower rating of 320 h.p. or less.</li>
<li>Turbine engine must be a production built engine, governor controlled not to exceed factory rpm and temperature limits.</li>
<li>Any turbine engine exceeding 8000 rpm on output shaft will not be allowed to use a clutch and flywheel assembly or automatic transmission. All driveline brake components, including caliper assembly, must be radially shielded 360 degrees with 1/4" steel and both ends must be closed with 1/8" steel or greater.</li>
<li>Turbine air intakes must be screened with metal screen that has openings no larger than 3/16".</li>
<li>A turbine engine must be equipped with an external shroud completely enclosing engine. Shroud to be made from no less than 1/4" steel or aluminum. Factory installed external shrouds allowed if material is equal to or greater in size and/or strength of external shroud specification.</li>
<li>Shroud must incorporate a flange at each end that extends radially inward from the shroud to within 1" of engine casing. A 1/2" air gap between the engine and the ID of the flange must be maintained for air circulation inside the shroud.</li>
<li>Flanges may be scalloped out to clear tubing, accessories, brackets, etc., and may be either rolled edges of the shroud or steel rings attached by welding or riveting to the shroud. Shroud must extend at least 3 in. beyond each end of turbine section unless limited by exhaust housing or other permanently attached engine components.</li>
<li>Turbine engine must be equipped with two separate overspeed protection devices for power turbine wheel(s). Turbine engine overspeed shutdown required.</li>
<li>Tractors powered with a turbine engine must have a stock appearing garden tractor hood and grill, (nose piece).</li>
<li>All other chassis, engine, and safety rules listed for the Super Modified class must be followed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All turbine engines must be inspected and certified by GSGTP Technical Services prior to registering or competing at a sanctioned event.</p>
