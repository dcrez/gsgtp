<p style="display: inline !important;">NOTE: Compact Diesel and Mini Rod vehicles, (including 4-cylinders) must also comply with additional or overriding rules [General Rules &ndash; Mini Rod].</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><h4>Seats</h4> All vehicles must have a secure seat. Seat may not extend behind rear tires. Seat must have a back, which stands a minimum of 3" above the top of the seat surface.</li>

<li><h4>Exhaust</h4>
<ul>
<li>Must discharge vertically (+ or - 10 degrees) upward and extend at least 12" from the exhaust port.</li>
<li>Exceptions to this rule are the use of stock mufflers or rear engine tractors, which may discharge out the back. Exhaust must be securely attached.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h4>Fenders</h4> All vehicles must have sturdy, safely secured fenders that will protect the driver from the tires.</li>
<li><h4>Stabilizer/Bumper Bars</h4>Must be installed on all vehicles in all classes.
<ul>
<li>The device must consist of two separate assemblies, each equipped with either a skid plate or a wheel.
<ul>
<li>Skid plates to be at least 2" wide x 3" long.</li>
<li>Wheels to be at least 1" wide and 4" in diameter.</li>
<li>Back edge of skid plate or center of wheel must be at least 5" but not more than 10" behind a line drawn vertical at rear face of tire. Maximum distance from ground to bottom edge of wheel or skid pad: 5".</li>
<li>One stabilizer bar shall be on each side of the tractor with the combination of the two strong enough to support the weight of the tractor when a jack is placed under them to raise the tractor when weighted to maximum weight for competition class with driver.</li>
<li>Bumper bars must be incorporated into each independent stabilizer bar. Bumper bar must extend 6" vertical from the rear most tip of skid pad or back edge of wheel. The top of the vertical bar must be braced forward to stabilizer bar or chassis. Stabilizer/ bumper bar set must be at least 8" apart. Bumper bars must be constructed strong enough to prevent buck board of sled from coming in contact with rear tires.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h4>Drawbars</h4>All vehicles must have a drawbar that is constructed from non-cast material and is stationary in all directions. Minimum drawbar thickness at hook point: 3/8", maximum 3/4". Point of hook minimum opening: 1 3/4" round hole, maximum 2" hole.
<ul>
<li>Minimum 1/2" cross section thickness required around any opening machined or manufactured into drawbar assembly. Minimum diameter of any attaching round stock or pivot pin: 1/2". Minimum of 5-3/8", Grade #5 bolts or equivalent welding strength required to secure drawbar assembly to differential housing or chassis.</li>
<li>Distance from hook point to back edge of drawbar not to exceed 3/4" thick. Drawbar to be parallel within 10 degrees and not more than 13 in. above the ground.</li>
<li>Area 5 in. wide and 12 in. high immediately above the drawbar must be free of all obstructions including weights and weight brackets for ease of hooking and unhooking chain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h4>Fuel Lines</h4> All vehicles must have fuel lines that are either routed and suspended to keep them away from hot engine components or steel braided lines.</li>
<li><h4>Fuel</h4>
<ul>
<li><h4>Alcohol (Methanol)</h4> It is a liquid with a mild odor at ambient temperatures. It is sold in two US Federal Grades: A and AA. Note: Methanol is tested and certified at GSGTP events through the application of various methods of chemical analysis as considered appropriate by Fuel Check personnel. Any deviation from these standards in the fuel sample will result in disqualification.
<ul>
<li>Each grade is acceptable for use in GSGTP competition.</li>
<li>Maximum specific gravity for GSGTP competition: .7928.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h4>Gasoline</h4> Gasoline is a mixture of hydrocarbons. It is a good electrical insulator, which is call dielectric. Its relative effectiveness as an insulator is represented by its "Dielectric Constant" (DC). The average DC for the hydrocarbons that comprise gasoline is 2.025. This is defined as a reading of 0 with the GSGTP Fuel Check meter. To compensate for possible temperature differences of gasoline, which can cause slight variations in the DC, the maximum acceptable meter reading is +5, with 0 as the reference reading. A gasoline that has a DC reading that is greater than 2.3 will cause the meter reading to be outside this range. The addition of compounds containing nitrogen and/or oxygen may produce a mixture with a DC reading that is greater than 2.3. Most gasoline will meet these criteria. It is recommended that unknown gas be checked before use in competition.</li>
<li><h4>Diesel Fuel</h4> Diesel fuel is defined by the GSGTP as a pure hydrocarbon. The GSGTP will evaluate diesel fuel using only the dielectric constant value. That value shall be determined by the GSGTP fuel check meter only. The GSGTP fuel check meter shall use only Cyclohexane to establish the zero reference point for determining all diesel fuel dielectric constant values. Diesel fuel to be used in GSGTP competition shall have a dielectric value of no greater than 4.9, nor a value of no less than 3.1. The use of additives containing oxygen, such as nitromethane, propylene oxide, dioxin, MTBE alcohol, or nitrous oxide, are strictly prohibited. These additives, and others of oxygen-bearing family, will significantly change the dielectric constant value of any diesel fuel. Diesel fuel with dielectric constant values that fall outside the GSGTP standards will not be allowed for use in competition.</li>
<li>Illegal Fuels
<ul>
<li>All forms of nitromethane (including nitrous oxide and propylene oxide) as a fuel or fuel additive for pulling.</li>
<li>Any oxygen improving chemical or agent is illegal in all divisions of GSGTP.</li>
<li>No pressurized fuels allowed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li><h4>Kill Switch</h4> A kill switch must be incorporated into all competition vehicles. Switch must be capable of immediately shutting down the engine as well as electric fuel pump(s), in case of accidental separation from the sled during the course of competition.
<ul>
<li>On diesel engines, the kill switch must activate the air shutoff. No electrically operated air shutoffs.
<ul>
<li>Diesel system must have a spring loaded air shut-off device activated by a cable.</li>
<li>Diesel system shall be deemed acceptable if it at least prevents the building of boost.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kill switch shall be located at the rear of the vehicle in a position that will allow for easy attachment/detachment. The switch must be located 14" (+or - 2 in.) above hook point and within 6" either direction of center.</li>
<li>Break-away kill switches must have a minimum 1 1/2 in. diameter solid ring (ring no less than 1/8 in. cross section thickness) attached to them.</li>
<li>Spiral type rings must be welded at each end to make ring solid. The cable from the sled must be attached to this ring.</li>
<li>Ring attaching portion of kill switch and mounting bracket(s) must be able to withstand 32 pounds of pull when switch is pulled. All single pin breakaway switches must be able to pivot left or right of center.</li>
<li>Kill switch ring must be secured with a single nylon tie wrap (1/8 in.). The tie wrap must be broken for a re-pull. Competitor will be responsible for replacing the kill switch mechanism and securing the tie wrap once kill switch is checked by tech official.</li>
<li>If vehicle has a kill switch or air shutoff located in a legal position, and during the pull attempt it is pulled and the nylon strap is broken and presiding official inspects and finds switch capable of operating properly under normal conditions, the vehicle will be allowed to re-pull immediately or drop six positions. The decision to drop must be made before the vehicle leaves the track. It is the competitor's responsibility to see that the switch is checked by the official before his vehicle leaves the track.</li>
