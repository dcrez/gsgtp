<li>Vehicles with second drawbars must have second drawbar hole covered.</li>
<li>Maximum drawbar height is 13". Minimum drawbar length is 6". Drawbar length is measured from the center of the rear axle to the point of hook.</li>
<li>Drawbar and stabilizer bars are not to be connected.</li>
<li>Drawbar distance from center of rear axle cannot change during pull.</li>
<li>GSGTP recommends that the drawbar not be used when tying the competing vehicle to the tow vehicle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h4>Tow Hitch</h4> All vehicles are required to have a tow hitch on the front of their vehicles.
<ul>
<li>The hitch can extend no more than 6" beyond the foremost portion of the vehicle.</li>
<li>The tow hitch will not be included when measuring the length of the vehicle.</li>
<li>The hitch must have a 2 1/2" hole, preferably positioned horizontally and strong enough to push or pull the vehicle at its heaviest weight.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h4>Damper</h4> A bolt is required in the crankshaft to retain damper assembly.</li>
<li><h4>Automotive Clutches, Flywheels and Automatic Transmissions</h4>
<ul>
<li>The use of torque converters and automatic transmissions will be permitted.</li>
<li>All torque converters and automatic transmissions must be covered with a scatter blanket that extends from the rear of engine block to the front of tail housing. Blanket must be fastened forward securely with two straps on each side, one above crankshaft centerline and one below crankshaft centerline. Blanket should have 6" of overlap. Straps must be not less than 2" wide with not more than 1" spacing between each strap.</li>

All vehicles using a clutch will be required to have steel billet or aluminum billet flywheel with the following mechanical properties: (a) tensile strength of 60,000 psi (b) yield strength of 40,000 psi. Exception: Due to the inability to obtain production billet flywheels for many 4-cylinder combinations, it will be acceptable to use a stock flywheel for such a combination, IF shrouded 360 degrees from the rear of the engine block to the rear of the clutch area. Shield to be made from a minimum 1/4-inch steel and mounted no more than 1/2-inch from bellhousing and covered with scatter blanket as described in [rule no. 2] in this section.</li>
<li>Lenco type planetary transmissions (excluding reverser) must be covered with a scatter blanket as described in rule no. 2 in this section.</li>
<li>All vehicles using an automatic transmission must be equipped with a positive reverse-gear lockout.</li>
<li>Bellhousing liners are very highly recommended.</li>
<li>Clutch can liner thickness to be 1/8" 4130 moly. Liner is secured to the can by drilling and tapping a single 1/4" hole through the bottom of the clutch can. If the liner does not fit, the liner length can be cut off to fit the depth of the can, so that the liner begins directly behind the starting ring gear (if one is used). It must extend the full length of the can until the back of the clutch begins to taper. If starter ring gear is not used, can liner must then extend from block saver plate rearward to where the can taper begins. Stand adjustment slot in liner should be cut directly under slot in can.</li>
<li>No lightening holes allowed on the transmission face of the bellhousing. One cooling hole allowed, maximum 1" in diameter on the face of bellhousing. Bellhousing may not be welded or repaired in the explosion area of the bellhousing. Opening in bellhousing for clutch release fork must be shielded on side, top, bottom, and rear with 1/4" steel no less than six inches wide. The frame of tractor may be used for the side shield. The top, rear, and bottom must be fastened to the frame and/or the bellhousing flange with a minimum of six (6) Grade #8, 3/8" bolts. The rear shield may have a hole large enough to allow operation of clutch rod linkage. No part of shield may be welded to or bolted to the bellhousing and shield must conform to the contour of the bellhousing.</li>
<li>No chemical milling allowed.</li>
<li>The inspection/maintenance hole (i/m hole) in the bellhousing shall not extend farther forward at its top edge than flush with the cross-shaft hole nor farther downward at its bottom edge than to allow one 1/2" bolt diameter edge distance for the fastening holes in both the bellhousing and the i/m hole cover. The length of the i/m hole shall be no more than 8 1/2" and the ends of the hole shall be smoothly and fully radiused to produce an oval shape.</li>
<li>There shall be (12) 5/6" grade #5 or better cap screws securing the cover to the bellhousing. The cover must have a plate or fillet that fits flush inside of the housing. The cover and fillet must be steel. The fillet must be welded to the cover and all bolts must be flush to the inside.</li>
<li>There must be five bolts used to secure the transmission to the bellhousing with a 3/8" minimum diameter.</li>
<li>All bellhousings must be flush on the inside surface.</li>
