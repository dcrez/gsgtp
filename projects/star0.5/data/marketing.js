It’s not that we don’t care or want to hang with you, it’s just that we thought you’d rather get more money in your pocket from the bill rate on the project, and isn’t that a lot more exciting than a bunch of junk food or chachkies that will collect dust on your shelf?"},
      {"p":"Moreover, STAR does not offer bloated overhead costs like fancy offices, multiple levels of management, or highly-compensated sales people. All of these things add up and take money out of your pocket. We run a lean operation that ensures our clients get talent at market rates, while giving you, the consultant, the bulk of the bill rate. Our low and transparent markup ensures that without all this unnecessary fluff in the system, you are getting the best rate possible on consulting gigs through STAR."}

We’ve led massive, cross-functional program and project teams and had to assemble the right portfolio of talent to get the job done.
