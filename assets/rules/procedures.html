</ol>
<h3><a name="_Toc444438929"></a>I.F&nbsp; Contest Procedures</h3>
<ol>
<li>Contestants must pull in the position drawn. In case of mechanical breakage which has been confirmed by a track official, contestant may drop to last position. If breakage is not evident, puller may drop 6 positions - this will constitute the pullers first attempt to pull and therefore will only have one remaining attempt to compete. From the moment that both track and sled are prepared for competition, the puller has 3 minutes to hook and make his/her attempt to pull.</li>
<li>Each driver has the right to have the sled spotted to a particular location on the starting line. The driver or assigned crew member is responsible to clearly request the location before the sled is returned to the starting line. In the case of a second attempt, a second location may be requested. Entire sled must be within the chalk lines at the start of pull attempt. No official pull may be started beyond the starting line nor in back of the starting line. All sleds must be started in gear and with front of sled even with starting line.</li>
<li>Each competitor will be allowed two attempts to make a measurable pull. An attempt is defined as moving the sled 1" or further. On first attempt, if the competitor lets off on the throttle before reaching the 75 ft. line, the competitor will get a second attempt, even if he/she went beyond the 75 ft. line. If no attempt is made to back off the throttle, no second attempt will be granted.</li>
<li>On any re-pull caused by contest malfunction, the competitor may either re- hook immediately or drop 6 positions.</li>
<li>Competitor will be able to drop to last if breakage occurs on his/her first attempt and he/she has let off the throttle previous to crossing the 75 ft. line. Puller will be eligible for 1 more attempt.</li>
<li>Any disqualification on first attempt bars a second attempt (see test puller). Should the class be restarted, the competitor disqualified (during the course of competition) will be allowed to re-pull in the position drawn.</li>
<li>If a class is restarted, all competitors having pulled previously will (in descending order) have the same options as the number one or test puller (see test puller). In the case of a restart, it is the competitor's responsibility to alert the track officials of his/her decision.</li>
<li>If the last competitor in the class has difficulties, this puller will have 6 minutes to hook to the sled and make their first attempt to pull.</li>
<li>If a vehicle is legal when hooked to a sled and breakage occurs while under the green flag, the pull will be measured.</li>
<li>All vehicles must be in neutral/park while being hitched and unhitched to/from sled.</li>
<li>All pulls must start with a tight chain.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="_Toc444438930"></a>I.G Test Puller</h3>
<ol>
<li>The competitor pulling in first position of each class, as determined by draw at time of entry is considered the test puller.</li>
<li>Provided that the weight transfer is deemed right, the test puller may:
<ul>
<li>accept their distance or</li>
<li>refuse their distance and immediately hook again for another potential two attempts or</li>
<li>refuse their distance and pull again in the sixth position. NOTE: Sixth position is defined as the position immediately following the next 5 competitors and their attempts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the test puller has mechanical problems during his/her test pull (before first official pull), the track official may grant the competitor the option of dropping to sixth position or to last position.</li>
<li>Only the test puller and only on his/her test pull, will the competitor have the option of dropping an out of bounds disqualification.</li>
<li>If a class is restarted, all competitors having pulled previously will (in descending order) have the same options as the number one or test puller.</li>
<li>It is the competitor's responsibility to inform the finish flagman as to his/her decision to take or drop the test pull. Leaving the track without informing the official(s) of his/her decision, forces the assumption that the test puller wishes to drop six positions.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="_Toc444438931"></a>I.H Pull-Off</h3>
<ol>
<li>A "floating finish line" may be used at the discretion of the head official and the sled operator in a pull-off situation only. The added distance shall be 10' maximum. Extended boundaries must be clearly marked. Competitors must be informed of floating finish line prior to the pull-off. This is an option and is not required at any event.</li>
<li>Order of pull-off will be in the order which the vehicles made full pulls (or tied distances).</li>
<li>In pull-off situations, the competitor does not have the option of dropping six positions, with the only exceptions being: if the pull-off is not run on the same track, or with the same sled, or on the same day, or contest malfunction. A rain delay will constitute a judgment call on the part of the GSGTP official, in regards to the degree in which the track has changed.</li>
<li>If a pull-off is not completed because of rain, curfew etc., purse monies and points for the places involved will be divided evenly among all those qualified for the pull-off.</li>
<li>In the case of a second pull-off, if all competitors qualified wish not to hook again, the points and purse for the places involved will be divided evenly.</li>
<li>Pullers eligible for a pull-off (who have no substantial proof of being broken), do not make an honest attempt to pull, he/she shall receive the same points as the top vehicle that did not qualify for the pull-off.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="_Toc444438932"></a>I.I&nbsp;&nbsp; Inclement Weather</h3>
<ol>
<li>A session of pulling will be called a completed show if 1/2 of the sanctioned classes have been run.</li>
<li>Any class canceled after 2/3 of the scheduled entries have pulled shall be considered a completed class for establishing if 1/2 of the classes of a session have run.</li>
<li>Purse money will be paid to those classes that are completed according to the results for those who have hooked. Those who did not hook in the class will share any remaining purse equally. Purse money for classes that do not compete will be divided equally at the time of cancellation.</li>
<li>If less than 1/2 of the session has been completed and the promoter does not refund the gate, admission the promoter shall pay purse to those entered in the canceled classes on the same formula described in rule #3 above.</li>
<li>If less than 1/2 of the session has been completed and the promoter does refund gate, purse will be paid in completed classes only. In classes where 2/3 of those entered have pulled, the purse for that class shall be paid only to those who have hooked according to results. Those who did not hook will receive a refund of entry fees. For classes not started or not 2/3 completed, competitors shall receive a refund of paid entry fees.</li>
<li>In any class in which all entered competitors do not get an official chance to compete, all competitors entered in that class, with the competition vehicle on grounds and ready to compete, will receive only inclement weather points (15 points to replace hook points).</li>
<li>The head official, promoter and event director shall be the only involved par- ties in determining if and when an event shall be stopped because of inclement weather or track conditions.</li>
<li>If a promoter adds (GSGTP approved) unscheduled classes, including inclement weather classes, to those already scheduled, the unscheduled classes will follow the scheduled classes. Exception: elimination rounds - due to the number of entries in a scheduled class.</li>
<li>If a rained out class is rescheduled on a date other than the originally scheduled pull dates, points will be given accordingly.</li>
<li>If a session is canceled more than 24 hours prior to the start time, no points will be given for that session.</li>
<li>If a session is canceled prior to the start time and the promoter retains no ticket revenue, competitors will receive a refund of paid entry fees, but no other financial compensation.</li>
<li>Any class not completed for any reason will be treated as a rained out class.</li>
</ol>
